# ⚙️ Automated Pre-screening

---

The **Automated Pre-screening** feature helps you streamline your recruitment process by filtering out unqualified candidates before human review. It saves time and ensures only relevant applications proceed further.

### 🛠 How it works

1. **Set Qualification Criteria**
   - Define key qualifications like years of experience, skills, location, etc.
   - Criteria can be configured per job during the job creation or edit flow.

2. **System Filters Applicants**
   - Every application submitted is automatically checked against the set criteria.
   - Those that fail to meet the baseline are marked or hidden from your review queue.

3. **View Filtered Applicants**
   - You can toggle between **All Applicants** and **Pre-screened** applicants in the job dashboard.

> 💡 This is especially helpful when handling high-volume job applications.
