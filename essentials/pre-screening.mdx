# ⚙️ Automated Pre-screening

The Automated Pre-screening feature helps streamline your recruitment workflow by combining resume analysis and intelligent candidate interaction, so only qualified, relevant applicants make it to your review stage.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

Automatically screens candidates right after they apply, by:

- Analyzing resumes  
- Matching them with the Job Description (JD)  
- Initiating a dynamic chat to evaluate skills and intent  
- Generating a comprehensive candidate report  

---

## 🛠 How It Works

### 1. Resume Upload  
Once a candidate applies, they are prompted to upload their resume.

### 2. Resume & JD Matching  
The platform’s AI engine scans the resume and matches it against the job-specific criteria such as:

- Experience  
- Skills  
- Location  
- Education  

### 3. Intelligent Chat Screening  
Once the resume is uploaded:

- A chat session is triggered automatically  
- The virtual assistant asks 10–12 contextual questions:
  - 3–4 HR questions (e.g., notice period, preferred location, expected CTC)  
  - 7–8 technical/domain-specific questions based on the JD  

### 4. Report Generation  
Based on:

- Resume match results  
- Chat responses  

The system generates a **pre-screening report** to help you identify the most relevant candidates.
