1. In the **Sub Domain** field, enter your desired subdomain:

## 🧾 Step 3: Update DNS Records

Once verification is initiated, you’ll see DNS settings that need to be configured:

- You can copy the records manually  
- Or click **Export DNS** to download and share with your technical team
- After DNS is configured, click the **Verify DNS** button.

> ⚠️ Be sure all DNS records are added correctly. DNS propagation may take 24–48 hours depending on your provider.

- Once all records are validated, you’ll see a success message:
  > ✅ *Your domain connection was successful.*
