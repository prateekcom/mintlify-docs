## Posting A Job

After successfully [logging](https://app.agentr.global/admin/login) into AgentR, you’ll be directed to the main dashboard — your central hub for managing the entire hiring process.

From there, click on the "Create Job" button on the top right to initiate the recruitment process — this is where you'll be prompted to enter key information such as the **Job Title and Job Description** in the provided fields.

After filling in the necessary details, you have two options:

- Save as Draft to review or post the job later, or
- Click Publish to make the job post live and start attracting candidates immediately.

Once you click **Publish**, **your job post goes live,** and you’ll receive a **unique application link**—this is where candidates will apply. You can share this link directly with your network, sourcing partners, hiring team, or post it on job boards and social media. All applications from any source will be collected through this central listing, keeping you streamlined and organized.
