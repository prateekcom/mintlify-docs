# 🤖 How AgentR Shortlists Smartly

Most systems rank candidates by keyword density. We do it by reading their story. AgentR’s AI shortlisting engine uses career reasoning — not just semantic matching — to surface top-fit candidates, even if they don’t follow traditional patterns.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

AgentR’s shortlisting engine mirrors how a great recruiter thinks and scales that insight:

### 1. Understands the Role
Analyzes the job description for responsibilities, expected outcomes, and core competencies.

### 2. Interprets Resumes as Stories
Goes beyond keywords to identify patterns of growth, adaptability, and intent in a candidate’s journey.

### 3. Scores Based on Fit
Each candidate is assigned a **Contextual Fit Score**, backed by explainable insights — not just job title matches.

### 4. Ranks and Presents
The dashboard surfaces high-context matches while giving you full control to explore every applicant manually.
