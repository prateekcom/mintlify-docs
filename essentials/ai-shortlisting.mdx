# ü§ñ AI Shortlisting
---

**AI Shortlisting** uses machine learning to identify top candidates based on how well their application matches the job description and other metadata.

### üß† How it works

1. **Job & Resume Analysis**
   - The system analyzes your job description and compares it against resumes submitted.
   - Factors like experience, skills, job titles, and certifications are weighed.

2. **Scoring Applicants**
   - Each applicant is given a **Relevance Score**.
   - The higher the score, the more aligned the applicant is to the role.

3. **Smart Sorting**
   - Your applicants list will show the most relevant candidates first.
   - You can still view and consider all other candidates manually.
